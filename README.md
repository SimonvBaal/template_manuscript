# Manuscript Template
A latex template for a manuscript.

The template consists of only a .tex file for portability. I include basic settings and packages for users to get started writing quickly or to develop their own template off the back of this one. The template also includes basic examples that assist users with creating figures and tables.

Please send an email to simonvanbaal.behsci@gmail.com with any questions about this template.
