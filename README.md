# Manuscript Template
A latex template for a manuscript.

The template consists of only the main.tex file for portability. I include basic settings and packages for users to get started writing quickly. The template also includes examples that assist users with creating figures and tables.

Please send an email to simonvanbaal.behsci@gmail.com with any questions about this template.
